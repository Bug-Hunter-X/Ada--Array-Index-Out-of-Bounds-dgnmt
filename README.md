# Ada Array Index Out of Bounds

This repository demonstrates a common error in Ada programming: accessing an array element outside of its declared bounds.  Ada's strong typing and range checking help prevent many runtime errors, but this particular error can be tricky to catch. The `bug.ada` file shows an example of this error, and `bugSolution.ada` provides a solution.

The solution involves careful checks on array indices before accessing them, or using safer array handling techniques if available.
